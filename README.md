# annotate-me

Interactive video streams for your online meetings.

annotate-me lets you add interactive emojis to your web conferencing platform. It uses TensorFlow JS to detect the users gestures and overlays a clip art on the screen.

This will help other's in the meeting to easily see the user's reaction.

Currently we have to use Open Brodcaster Software for displaying the video but our original goal was to not use any 3rd party software and we were not able to finish it on time.

You can run the TFJS project on your localhost and use a tool like OBS to use it as the video feed for platforms like Zoom and Google Meet replacing your webcam and overlaying it with annotate-me.
